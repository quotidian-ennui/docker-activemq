Vanilla ActiveMQ running in docker

Since rmohr/activemq hasn't built a docker image for a few months; here's 5.15.11+ activemq running using
* openjdk:8-jre-slim
* azul/zulu-openjdk-alpine:8-jre

Eventually I'll get bored too, and not update and so the cycle goes on; however the associated github project is here : https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/docker-activemq
